Jagadish : A Machine Learning Lifecycle builder
=============================================

I work with Bosch group to streamline machine learning development.

* `MLflow Tracking <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html>`_: An API to log parameters, code, and
  results in machine learning experiments and compare them using an interactive UI.
* `MLflow Projects <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html>`_: A code packaging format for reproducible
  runs using Conda and Docker, so you can share your ML code with others.
* `MLflow Models <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html>`_: A model packaging format and tools that let
  you easily deploy the same model (from any ML library) to batch and real-time scoring on platforms such as
  Docker, Apache Spark, Azure ML and AWS SageMaker.
* `MLflow Model Registry <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html>`_: A centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of MLflow Models.
